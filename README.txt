# Winged Game

Winged Game is an interactive game built using the Processing. Built in 2024 as a first programming project. Made with passion for aesthetic game visual and with motivation to improve coding skills. This project is far from perfect, but it works. 

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GabrielaCigerova/winged_game.git
   cd winged_game

Open the project in Processing. 

	or

Download Processing (https://processing.org/download) - no installation required. 
Open any file in the Processing IDE and press START / RUN button.

3. **Gameplay**

Use the arrow keys to navigate the bird up or down.

The game ends if the player's score drops lower than zero. It's that simple.
